    "We have two scenarios:\n",

    "1. The white ball was added to Basket 1, which already had a white ball. If the first drawn ball is white, the second ball will definitely be white. The probability of choosing Basket 1 is $ \\frac{1}{2} $, and the probability of drawing a white ball from Basket 1 after adding the white ball is $ 1 $ since both balls are white.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The white ball was added to Basket 2, which had a black ball. If the first drawn ball is white, the second ball must be black. The probability of choosing Basket 2 is $ \\frac{1}{2} $, but in this case, the probability of drawing a white ball first is $ \\frac{1}{2} $ (since there's one white and one black ball).\n",

    "\n",
    "$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$\n",

    "We know that $ P(B|A) = 1 $ because if the second ball is white, the first ball must have been white. $ P(A) $ is the probability that the second ball is white without any prior information, which is $ \\frac{1}{2} $ (since there's an equal chance of adding the white ball to either basket). $ P(B) $ is the probability of drawing a white ball first, which we need to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate $ P(B) $, we consider both scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The white ball is added to Basket 1, and a white ball is drawn: $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2} $.\n",
    "2. The white ball is added to Basket 2, and a white ball is drawn: $ \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $ P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} $.\n",
